    "Suppose you are writing a paper and, as is prone to happening when you have a lot of complicate thoughts buzzing around your brain, you've reorganized your ideas several times. Automatic section numbering will go through your Notebook and number your sections and subsection as designated by your Header Cells. This means that if you've moved one or more big sections around several times, you won't have to go through your paper and renumber it, as well as all its subsections, yourself.\n",

    "\n",
    "So, even if you have previously numbered your sections, Automatic Section Numbering will go through your document, delete the current section numbers, and replace them the correct number in a linear sequence. This means that if your third section was once your second, Automatic Section Numbering will delete the \"2\" in front of your section's name and replace it with a \"3.\" \n",

You've unsurprisingly titled the section where you summarize and analyze this book **`2 Cats`**. Automatic Section Numbering will assume the number 2 is section information and delete it, leaving just the title **`Cats`** behind. If you bold, italicize, or place the title of the section inside quotes, however, the entire section title will be be preserved without any trouble. It should also be noted that even if you must title a section with a number occurring before any letters and you do not want to bold it, italicize it, or place it inside quotes, then you can always run Automatic Section Numbering and then go to that section and retype its name by hand. \n",

If you have two sections that begin with Header 1 Cells in your paper, and each of the sections has two subsections that begin with Header 2 Cells, Automatic Section Numbering will number them 1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 2.1, and 2.2 respectively. If, however, you have used a Header 3 Cell to indicate the beginning of what would have been section 2.1, Automatic Section Numbering will number that section 2.0.1 and an error message will appear telling you that \"You placed a Header 3 cell under a Header 2 Cell in section 2\". Similarly, if you begin your paper with any Header Cell smaller than a Header 1, say a Header 3 Cell, then Automatic Section Numbering will number your first section 0.0.3 and an error message will appear telling you that \"Notebook begins with a Header 3 Cell.\"\n"

These Notebooks don't use Markdown because it's definitely better, but rather because it's different and thus encourages users to think about their work differently. \n",

    "It is very important for computer science students to learn how to conceptualize input and output as dependent, but also distinct. One good reason to use Markdown is that it encourages this kind of thinking. Relatedly, it might also promote focus on substance over surface aesthetic. Markdown is somewhat limited in its style options, which means that there are inherently fewer non-subject-specific concerns to agonize over while working. It is the conceit of this philosophy that you would, by using Markdown and this Notebook, begin to think of the specific stylistic rendering of your cells as distinct from what you type into those same cells, and thus also think of the content of your writing as necessarily separate from its formating and appearance.

In other words, the length of a hard-wrapped line is determined either by the number of words in the line (in the case of word processing software where this number is predetermined and the program wraps for the user automatically), or individual intention (when a user manually presses an Enter or Return key to control exactly how long a line is).\n",

    "Bibliographic Support makes managing references and citations in your Notebook much easier, by automating some of the bibliographic process every person goes through when doing research or writing in an academic context. There are essentially three steps to this process for which your Notebook's Bibliographic support can assist: gathering and organizing sources you intend to use, citing those sources within the text you are writing, and compiling all of the material you referenced in an organized, correctly formatted list, the kind which usually appears at the end of a paper in a section titled \"References,\" \"Bibliography,\" or \"Works Cited. \n",

    "\n",
    "If you do both these things, the \"Generate References\" button will be able to do its job by replacing all of your cite commands with validly formatted in-text citations and creating a References section at the end of your document, which will only ever include the works you specifically cited within in your Notebook. \n",

This way, you can also title your References section \"Bibliography\" or \"Works Cited,\" if you want.\n",

The best part of this is that any Notebook containing validly formatted [cite commands][cc] can check your external database and find only the items that you have indicated you want to cite.

    "Unlike [external bibliographic databases][exd], which are comprised from an entire separate notebook, internal bibliographic databases consist of only one cell within in the Notebook in which you are citing sources and compiling a References list. The single cell, like all of the many BibTex cells that can make up an external database, must begin with **`<!--bibtex`** and end with **`-->`** in order to be validly formatted and correctly interpreted by your Notebook's Bibliographic Support. It's probably best to keep this cell at the very end or the very beginning of your Notebook so you always know where it is.
